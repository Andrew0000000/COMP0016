        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <h2>Requirement Gathering</h2>
            <p>
                After discussing methods of gathering user requirements, we decided to send out Google Forms to General Practitioners (GPs) 
                and Patients to fill them up. Below are some responses from the GPs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>GPs</h3>
                <div>Q1: Are there areas of your work that can be automated/optimised? If yes, please specify</div>
                <i>Yes, the most time-consuming part of our job is determining the type of illness the patient is suffering from. 
                    This is because a high level of accuracy is needed to ensure that the right prescriptions are given to them. 
                    It would also be useful if we are able to see all the past medical reports of a patient, stored in a dataset, 
                    compiled in a more readable format.</i>
                <div>Q2: Do you want a platform that assists in optimising workflow/automation? Why or why not?</div>
                <i>yes. We realise that the waiting time for meeting GPs is very long and we are trying to find ways to cut it short 
                    to improve the experience of patients with GPs. A platform where GPs can analyse previous medical records using 
                    some AI functionalities and draw useful data from it would be really helpful</i>
                <div>Q3: If we were to build a connector accessing IBM Watson's APIs, what features would you like to see?</div>
                <i>We would like to accurately identify the type of illness the patient is suffering and carry out the best 
                    procedure for them. The use of AI to analyse data from patients and match them with our dataset to identify 
                    illnesses would save a lot of time. Ideally, the platform should also be simple to use and with minimal and 
                    clean UI to encourage GPs to use it.</i>
                <h3>Patients</h3>
                <div>Q1: How often do you visit your GP? How are your experiences with them so far?</div>
                <i>Around once in three months. My experiences with GPs were great except the part where it is always a long queue for getting a time slot. 
                    It takes weeks or sometimes even months just to meet my GP. Due to the long wait, I usually only visit my GP if I'm suffering from 
                    a more serious illness or if I've been ill for quite some time</i>
                <div>Q2: Which process of your visit takes the longest time/longer than it should be?</div>
                <i>Getting a time slot to meet the GP/waiting at the hospital. Sometimes it could be hours and hours of just sitting in the 
                    hospital waiting to be attended by one of the staff. It can get quite frustruating.</i>
                <div>Q3: Do you have any suggestion on how to speed those processes up/automate those tasks?</div>
                <i>NHS should be provided with a platform that helps GPs by automating the scheduling of tasks and appointments or help with 
                    medical prescriptions to optimise workflow. This is because I think GPs are spending way too much unnecessary time on a patient 
                    and some of their tasks should be automated. Also, it should accurately estimate the waiting time for patients in the hospital so 
                    instead of waiting for hours in the queue, we could just show up 10-15 minutes before the appointment.</i>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p>
                With the responses from google forms, we constructed personas for both our stakeholders to design a platform that meets their needs.
