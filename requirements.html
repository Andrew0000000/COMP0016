        <h2>Requirement Gathering</h2>
        <p>We sent Google Forms to stakeholders to collect their feedback regarding their needs and preference, which were used to construct personas</p>
        <div>
            <h2>Personas</h2>
            <h3>We created two personas, an NHS GP and a patient who frequently requires NHS services</h3>
            <p>John Smith is an NHS GP with over 20 years of experience. He hopes the platform can assist in identifying patients' possible illness based on symptoms, suggest appropriate treatment
                plans, as well as predicting potential health threats.
            </p>
            <p>
                He believes the platform shouldn't have a complicated UI that displays large amounts of unsorted data in plain text. Apart from that, due to his busy everyday workload, he
                isn't sure if he will have sufficient time to explore the steep learning curve of using the platform, so he wants it to be kept simple.

                "Ideally, I would like a good visualizing database with patients' personal information and past medical records, and an AI tool that predicts possible illnesses that a patient is suffering from
                based on medical issues faced by people with similar symptoms."
