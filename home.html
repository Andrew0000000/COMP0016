        <div>
            The NHS serves (millions?) of people around the UK every day. With the increasing number of people suffering from various health
            problems and the outbreak of COVID-19 in the last several years, the supply of services are simply struggling to keep up with 
            the demand. This has led to unreasonably long wait times for some patients requiring urgent medical attention, which may put their 
            lives in danger. It also means that NHS staff are facing immense stress in their everyday work.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>In order to reduce the workload of NHS staff and shorten the waiting time for patients, we believe implementing automation
            could be a viable solution. IBM Watson provides natural language processing capabilities, which can be used to automatically 
            schedule patient appointments by reading text messages. Microsoft Power Platform allows users to interact with APIs without
            having to code hands-on through custom connectors.
        </div>

            Our idea has been tested by some NHS workers and based on the feedback received, it has successfully reduced their workload as 
            a lot of repetitive tasks can now be completed using automation.
